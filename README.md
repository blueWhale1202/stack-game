# Stack Game

## Introduction

Stack Game is a fun and addictive arcade-style game where players must carefully stack moving blocks to build the tallest tower possible. The goal is to align each block precisely on top of the previous one, and any misalignment results in the block getting cut, making it harder to continue stacking. The game ends when the player can no longer place a new block on the shrinking platform.

## Features

-   Simple yet engaging gameplay mechanics
-   Increasing difficulty as the tower grows taller
-   Smooth animations and responsive controls
-   Score tracking to challenge yourself and others

## How to Play

1. Press or tap to drop the moving block.
2. Try to align it perfectly with the previous block.
3. If misaligned, the block gets trimmed, making it harder.
4. Keep stacking until no more blocks can fit.
5. Aim for the highest score and challenge your friends!
